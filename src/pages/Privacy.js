              AdtechAI, and our publishing partners, Clients, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer websites, track users' movements around websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. When you access and interact with AdtechAI (as a representative of a business), AdtechAI and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. We collect this information in the context of our business relationship with you, to allow you to explore the business solutions we offer on our platform. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis. As to information submitted to, through or on our website, we may likewise use service providers to host content, host or implement blogs and forums, or conduct data and marketing analytics with respect to information captured.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              AdtechAI may use a variety of technologies, including "cookies" that automatically or passively collect information from your computer, mobile device or other technology, when you visit AdtechAI, partner or Client websites. We may also collect information in this way on a third party's behalf when we serve advertisements and store your Personal Data in log files.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Usage Information may be associated with anonymous business profile information about you, such as your industry, company size, and job title. The purpose of this information is to keep the Platform updated and relevant to our users and to tailor content to each individual's interests. AdtechAI does not use this information to discern your identity or to disclose your identity to any third party. AdtechAI stores Personal Data in a separate database from any Usage Information.

              A cookie is a small file stored on a user's device containing information about the user. We may use cookies to reduce or pre-populate registration fields so that you can receive free content more easily, deliver targeted advertising, or understand your interests and focus areas of research. We believe this enables us to provide users with a more meaningful online experience.

            <p className="mb-4">
              We may use third-party vendors to enhance the Platform (e.g. for purposes of retargeting).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If you opt-out of targeted advertising, AdtechAI will no longer use or disclose any of your Personal Data, with the exception of Personal Data submitted within the last 30 days to access free content, which the Content Provider may access.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When you opt out of targeted advertising, we place a cookie on or otherwise identify your browser or device (and/or employ similar technology) to prevent future collection of Usage Information. Opting out of targeted advertising is not the same as blocking cookies. When you opt out of AdtechAI's Platform, we will place a special AdtechAI cookie on (or otherwise identify) your device or browser in a way that informs our systems not to record information related to your business research activities. If you browse the web from multiple devices or browsers, you will need to opt out from each device or browser to ensure that we prevent personalization tracking on all of them. For the same reason, if you procure a new device, change browsers or delete the AdtechAI opt-out cookie (or clear all cookies), you will need to perform this opt-out task again.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Please note: This opt-out relies on a cookie and so if you wipe all of your cookies, we will no longer know that you have opted out.

            <p className="mb-4">
              In instances where you visit a Client website through the AdtechAI Platform, the Client may use third-party vendors for the purposes of retargeting. We do not disclose Personal Data to these third parties, but they may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device and they may otherwise collect or have access to anonymous Usage Information.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">Your CCPA Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your rights under the CCPA and explains how to exercise those rights. Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the right to make the following requests:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Right to Opt-out of Sale or Sharing:</strong> You have the right to direct us not to sell your Personal Information or share it for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising ("opt-out"). We do not sell or share Personal Information if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age.</li>
              <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete and direct any service providers that have received that Personal Information to delete, the Personal Information that you have provided to us, unless an exemption applies. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will delete (and, if applicable, direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exemption applies.</li>
              <li><strong>Right to Correct:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information.</li>
              <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will disclose to you the information required by law.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Submitting Requests:</strong> You can submit a deletion, access or opt out of sale request by using one of the means provided below or in the "Contact Us" section:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Submit a request online here</li>
              <li>Call 9145236060</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We will respond to verifiable requests received from California residents as required by law. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf, but the agent must provide proof that the agent is authorized to make a request on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We may ask you for additional information necessary to verify or process your request. Where applicable, we may ask for proof that an authorized agent is entitled to act on your behalf. We may also carry out checks, including with third party identity verification services, to verify your identity before taking any action with your Personal Information. We will endeavor to respond your verifiable requests within 45 days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 additional days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request receipt. Generally, California residents can exercise rights free of charge.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              You may also choose to enable online, where available, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences, such as the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"). We will process the GPC signal as a request to opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights or impose unreasonable requirements on financial incentives offered to California consumers related to your Personal Information.
